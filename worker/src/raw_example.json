Using steam age magic, it is possible to fully transmutate / duplicate nuggets at that point in the game. This unlocks huge amounts of potential and opens up speedruns being able to skip the BBF. Reverse-engineering the code proved useful and enabled obtaining research we need (Yes I kept saying metallurgical perfection... oops).\n\nBook (from my Discord) put together this lovely program for the code if y'all want to use it easier, big ups for them :) https://jsfiddle.net/qgsk63vf\n\nThe actual code will be pasted in the description since it is too long.\n\nLike and subscribe for more GTNH content.\nHope you enjoy :)\n\nJoin my Discord for further progression updates and stream notifications:\nhttps://discord.gg/ufa5xm9PK7\nFollow my Twitch if you want to catch this live:\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/duckedgtnh",
